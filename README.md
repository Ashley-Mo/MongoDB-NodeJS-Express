MEAN Stack minus A 


My project Form-MongoDB Summary:

A form.html is created which takes up the data with the support of a Node JS framework, saves it in a data base run by the local system. The data can also be retrieved by using Mongodb Collections.

About Mongo and Node.js

MongoDB is an open-source, document database designed with both scalability and developer agility in mind. MongoDB bridges the gap between key-value stores, which are fast and scalable, and relational databases, which have rich functionality. Instead of storing data in rows and columns as one would with a relational database, MongoDB stores JSON documents in collections with dynamic schemas.

Node.js is an asynchronous, event-driven engine where the application makes a request and then continues working on other useful tasks rather than stalling while it waits for a response. On completion of the requested task, the application is informed of the results via a callback (or a promise or Observable. This enables large numbers of operations to be performed in parallel â€“ essential when scaling applications. MongoDB was also designed to be used asynchronously and so it works well with Node.js applications.
